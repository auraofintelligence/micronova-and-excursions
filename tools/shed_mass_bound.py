How much mass can the Sun have shed, before the planets say no?

The shedding hypothesis has never had a quantitative bound put on it, by
either side. This is the elementary one, and it needs no new data.

Two regimes, and the difference matters:

  SLOW loss (mass lost over many orbits, as the Sun does now)
      Orbits expand adiabatically and stay near-circular.
      da/a = dM/M, and the orbital period lengthens at twice that rate.

  IMPULSIVE loss (a shell shed in far less than one orbital period)
      The planet keeps the velocity vector it had. The Sun is suddenly
      lighter, so that velocity is now too fast for a circular orbit and
      the planet swings outward onto an ellipse.

      Starting circular at radius r, losing fraction f of the solar mass:
          v^2 = GM/r                       (unchanged at the instant)
          mu' = GM(1-f)                    (new gravitational parameter)
          1/a' = 2/r - v^2/mu'  =>  a' = r(1-f)/(1-2f)
          e = f/(1-f)
          r is the new perihelion; aphelion = r(1-f)/(1-2f) * (1+e)

      At f = 0.5 the planet is unbound. This is the classic result and it
      is the hard ceiling on any impulsive shedding claim.
