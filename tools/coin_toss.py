The Sun sprays, the Sun rotates, and Earth is somewhere in the spray pattern.

This needs no micronova, no excursion and no cadence. It is entirely
mainstream space weather statistics, and it is the strongest "why bother"
argument available, so it should have a number on it rather than a vibe.

Two things combine.

  GEOMETRY.  A big eruption leaves from wherever the active region happens
  to be. Published work finds that coronal mass ejections launched from
  roughly E40 to W40 solar longitude are the ones that reach Earth, and that
  about 59 per cent of full-halo CMEs from that window actually arrive.
  Everything outside it mostly sails past. The Sun turns about once a month,
  so that window comes round and round.

  RATE.  Carrington-class events are not rare in the Sun's terms. Riley's
  much-cited estimate puts them near 10 to 12 per cent per decade AT EARTH.
  The July 2012 event, measured by STEREO-A, was assessed as comparable to
  or stronger than Carrington. Earth had been at that longitude about a week
  earlier.
