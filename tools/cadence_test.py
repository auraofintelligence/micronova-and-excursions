Is there a clean cycle in the excursion dates, or is it a scatter?

This site has been asserting "a scatter, not a beat" for L5 without ever
running the number, which is the same failure it criticises elsewhere. So
here is the number.

Method: Rayleigh test on circular phase.

  For a candidate period P, map each event age t to a phase angle
  theta = 2*pi*(t mod P)/P. If the events are periodic at P, the phases
  cluster and the resultant vector of the unit phasors is long. If they
  are scattered, the resultant is short.

      R = |sum(exp(i*theta))| / n          (0 = uniform, 1 = perfectly clustered)

  Under the null hypothesis of uniform phase, n*R^2 is approximately
  exponentially distributed, giving p ~ exp(-n*R^2) for modest n.

  Because the period is not specified in advance but searched over a range,
  the best-fitting period will always look better than it is. So the script
  also reports a "look-elsewhere" corrected significance by running the same
  search on randomised date sets and asking how often pure noise scores at
  least as well.

Dates: proposed geomagnetic excursions of the last ~30 kyr, including the
ones this site's own ladder audit found to be unconfirmed, because excluding
them would stack the test.
