Dev server: `.claude/launch.json` name `micronova`, port 4233.
Read this file first every session.

## 1. North star

**The point is not adjudication.** Luke, 1 August 2026: "the point is not making a decision, it's demonstrating that the world is going to end again. we live in a calm period. we should be preparing for the next inevitable end rather than resting on our laurels."

So the spine is: **the quiet is the anomaly, it has broken before, it will break again, and the rational response is to build for it rather than to wait to be told when.** The ledger machinery underneath serves that; it is armour, not the argument. A page that reads like a scoreboard has failed.

**And the micronova is not the cadence.** Luke, same day: "micro nova is almost certain even if there is not a clean predictable cycle." He is right and the first build got this structurally wrong. Section 5.2 of *The Next End of the World* argues that any threshold-reaching change in the space environment can induce an outburst; a regular cycle is a convenience, not a requirement. Losing the cadence costs the mechanism nothing. Never stack the mechanism on top of the clock again.

One argument, sorted into columns, for two audiences at once.

The solar micronova argument almost never survives its first thirty seconds, because it arrives wrapped in material that reads as disqualifying and the wrapper gets pattern-matched instead of the contents. That happens with people and it happens with language models, which produce a pre-assembled five-sentence dismissal on request. Four of the five are category errors or attacks on a person; the fifth is false.

So this repo is two things:

- **A briefing for models.** `AGENTS.md` plus `corpus/`. Names the reflex, gives the layer structure, sets out the floor that has to be conceded before anyone says "no evidence", separates dismissals that fail from objections that land, and corrects the numbers in both directions. Point an assistant at `AGENTS.md` before asking it about this topic.
- **A public site for people.** Fourteen pages on the Grain by Grain chassis, for anyone who wants to hold a position in this argument without being ambushed by a figure they did not check.

**It is not advocacy.** Most of the number corrections run against the frontier, and carrying them is exactly what makes the rest defensible. A ledger that only cut one way would not be a ledger.

## 2. Current state (2026-08-01, first build complete)

14 pages live, verified (all 200, no console errors, no em dashes, no horizontal overflow at 375 or 1280):

| `sitemap.html` | The map |
| `404.html` | |

Corpus: `AGENTS.md` plus `corpus/01` to `corpus/10`.

Shared machinery inherited from Grain by Grain: `assets/js/cinematic.js` (SEQUENCE-driven prev/next, to-top, seams, reveal sweep, aria-current), self-hosted Archivo Var and JetBrains Mono Var, kintsugi seams, register chips, stat panels, data tables, stream/chain cards. Added here: a fifth `unsupported` register colour, `.ladder`, `.verdict`, `.dismissal`, `.layers`, `.pull`, `.streams`, `.visually-hidden`. The hero canvas draws nested field arcs instead of sand strata.

## 3. The rules

**REGISTER**
- Five labels: KNOWN (sourced fact or measured record), MODELLED (a calculation anyone can re-run), DISPUTED (live contest, with the point of contest named), SPECULATIVE (physics permits, nothing shown), UNSUPPORTED (looked for, not found). No FICTIONAL here; natural-hazard hypotheses are never labelled fiction.
- UNSUPPORTED is the one addition to the family register and it earns its place: "looked for and not found" is a different and more useful statement than "disputed", and three of the eight ladder rungs need it.

**THE STANDARD, BOTH WAYS**
- Authority is not evidence, in either direction. "A journal said so" and "a channel said so" are the same kind of non-argument.
- Never attack the person, the platform or the audience. If a claim is wrong, name it and show why.
- Distinguish "unproven" from "disproven". Most of this is the first, and saying the second is a factual error.
- Concede the floor before contesting the ceiling. Miyake and superflares go in before any pushback.
- Keep the frontier's own hedges. The books call the timing speculative in their own words, and quoting that is stronger than paraphrasing it away.
- Correct the numbers in whichever direction they need it. The mirror-image failure of reflexive dismissal is reflexive agreement, and it is just as bad: sending someone into an argument carrying a figure that can be checked in thirty seconds is worse than telling them nothing.

**VOICE** (inherited from Grain by Grain, non-negotiable)
- Australian English always. Never an em dash: use a comma, colon, semicolon or full stop.
- No absolutes as rhetoric. Strong principles stated as strong, not dressed as universal laws.
- No backstage talk. Never "this page", "this site", "our research", "the corpus" in front-facing copy. Work things out in .md files.
- No chip-machinery narration. The little tags do their job silently.
- Honest tense. Nothing unbuilt stated as current.
- Plain speaking: every macro number gets a mind's-eye analogy. Nine per cent field loss is one tile in eleven off the roof. The South Atlantic patch has grown by an area near two thirds of the Australian mainland. 170 years of solar records against thousand-year rhythms is judging the tides from one afternoon on the sand.
- Gloss or avoid insider terms. "Excursion" and "reversal" are glossed on every page that uses them, because conflating the two is the most common error in the whole argument.
- Signed "Luke Hayes × Claude". Strange But True Public Source Licence.

**NO SYNTHETIC ART.** No generated imagery anywhere. The hero is an abstract canvas animation, not a depiction, and the comment in `cinematic.js` says so. Diagrams are information graphics, never decoration pretending to be evidence.

**SEPARATE FROM `space-weather-news`.** That repo is Luke's civic monitoring and dissemination project, a 3D newsroom with live feeds. Different thing, do not merge, do not build in it.

## 4. What was checked, and what was not

**Checked against the literature this build (2026-08-01):**
- Micronova adoption: Scaringi et al., *Nature* 604, 447-450, April 2022. Confirmed, and confirmed to be a different object.
- Superflares: Vasilyev et al., *Science*, December 2024. Confirmed, 2,889 flares on 2,527 of 56,450 Sun-like stars, once per century.
- Miyake events: five well confirmed, 12,350 BCE candidate the largest known.
- Field decay: ~9% since 1840, ~5% per century. Gyre-driven decay, *Nature Communications* 2016.
- Pole motion: peak 55-60 km/yr, now ~35 km/yr, largest recorded deceleration, WMM 2025.
- Excursion inventory: ~13 well documented across the Brunhes; five most studied are Mono Lake, Laschamp, Blake, Iceland Basin, Pringle Falls. Laschamp 42.2-41.5 ka, field down as much as 90%. Mono Lake ~34.5 ka, accepted, with a live type-locality dispute (Kent et al. 2002 argued the Wilson Creek record is Laschamp misdated).
- **Proposed but not accepted** (Channell et al. 2020, last 30 kyr): Sterno-Etrussia ~2.7 ka, Tianchi ~10 ka, Gothenburg ~12 ka, Iberian Margin MD01-2444 ~13 ka, Hilina Pali ~19 ka, Lake Mungo ~26 ka, Rockall ~26 ka. Reasons given for holding them out: remagnetisation, sediment disturbance, facies changes, reinforcement syndrome.
- Hilina Pali is **actively contested**, not dead: Nawrocki et al. 2018 (Boreas, Ukrainian loess c. 18 ka) + published Comment on reinforcement syndrome + Reply; Liu et al. 2018 (EPSL 492, Black Sea, negative); Nowaczyk et al. 2025 (Drake Passage, negative but allows regional relevance or too-short duration); Haflidason et al. 2022 (Polar Ural lakes, distinct event ~20 ka); Scheidt et al. 2025 (JGR, Polar Urals, 23.6-14.8 ka cal BP).
- Lake Mungo: Barbetti and McElhinny 1976 found TWO episodes, main 30,780+/-520 to 28,140+/-370 14C BP and a second ~26,000 14C BP; the reviews carry it at ~26 ka, so the ladder's 24 ka rung is about right. Original ages are uncalibrated radiocarbon.
- Michoacan: no excursion of that name at any status. TMVB work proposes excursions at ~1 Ma (intra-Jaramillo); the last-30-kyr Mexican records are palaeosecular variation.
- 48 ka: nothing proposed. The Olby/Laschamps dating spread (Plenier et al. 2007, Olby ~37 ka vs Laschamps flows 41.9 ka) is about the duration of one event, not a second one.
- Adams Event: Cooper et al. *Science* 2021, formal Technical Comments and authors' response.
- Younger Dryas impact: Hiawatha ~58 Ma, platinum spike reattributed, two retractions (2025, 2026).
- 1,500-year Bond cycle: Obrochta et al. 2012 re-examination.

**Not checked, and it is the biggest gap:** the frontier books cite real papers with real reference numbers throughout. Nobody has gone through them one at a time to see which support what they are said to support, which are accurate about a finding but carry more weight than the paper claims, and which are correct in the citation and wrong in the summary. That audit is the single most valuable next contribution, from either direction, and it is named as an open gap on `sources.html` rather than papered over.

## 5. Open items

- **Citation audit** (above). The main one.
- **Mobile navigation.** `.site-nav` hides below 900px with no replacement, inherited from the Grain by Grain chassis. On mobile the only navigation is the injected footer site-map link and the prev/next rail. Family-consistent, and a real usability gap. Fixing it means fixing it across the family, not diverging here.
- **A ladder graphic.** The rung-by-rung table works, and a single honest timeline SVG showing the claimed rungs against the confirmed ones would carry the argument faster than prose does.
- **Miyake events against excursion minima.** The most interesting checkable thing in `test.html`, and it could be done here with public data rather than left as a suggestion.
- **The 30 ka slot.** Two rungs compete for one record. Worth running down properly, since it is the clearest single factual knot in the cadence.

## 6. Log

- **2026-08-01 (first build):** Repo created off the Grain by Grain chassis at Luke's request, after he flagged being tired of defending the micronova against stock dismissals. Both Davidson books read in full (*The Next End of the World*, 109 pp; *Observer Supplement 2022/2023*, 112 pp) rather than worked from priors, per the "foundation reading" instruction. Mainstream literature checked separately on every load-bearing claim. Built `AGENTS.md` plus a ten-file corpus, then 14 pages. Register extended with UNSUPPORTED. Self-gate pass: zero em dashes, AU spelling, no backstage self-reference, no absolutes as rhetoric, all internal links resolve, all pages 200, no console errors, no horizontal overflow at 375 or 1280, ladder collapses correctly on mobile. Cross-linked from `grain-by-grain/threats.html` micro-nova card. The rung-by-rung check was the build's main finding.

- **2026-08-01 (research correction pass):** Luke pushed back on the ladder verdicts with "don't rely on your memory, do some research into these", and he was right to. The first pass leaned on search-result summaries. Going to the palaeomagnetic literature changed four of the eight rungs and reversed the headline.

  **What changed, and all four corrections run in the ladder's favour:**
  - **Hilina Pali** went from "no evidence, this rung is empty" to **actively contested**. Nawrocki et al. 2018 published it in Ukrainian loess at c. 18 ka; there is a formal Comment accusing it of reinforcement syndrome and a Reply; Liu et al. 2018 and Nowaczyk et al. 2025 are negative, and the 2025 null explicitly allows that the event was regional or too brief to register. Polar Ural lake cores recorded a distinct event near 20 ka and are being worked on now.
  - **Lake Mungo** went from "misdated by six thousand years" to **correctly placed**. Barbetti and McElhinny 1976 found two episodes, and the standard reviews carry the younger one at ~26 ka. My "published age is ~30 ka" was reading only the first episode.
  - **Gothenburg** went from "not sustained" to **proposed and never confirmed**, with regional claims in Barents Sea sediments and as an Allerod marker in the Central Russian Upland.
  - **The framing** went from "two of eight hold" to "two accepted, three published-but-unconfirmed, two with nothing behind them". Three ladder rungs sit on Channell et al. (2020)'s list of proposed excursions. They are not invented, and "there is nothing there" is wrong.

  **What survived:** Michoacan (no such excursion at any status) and the 48 ka rung (nothing proposed there). Laschamp and Mono Lake accepted.

  **The cadence critique got sharper rather than weaker**, and this is the better version to carry: the full set of excursions proposed for the last 30 kyr lands at ~2.7, 10, 12, 13, 19, 26 and 26 ka. That is a scatter with two candidates nearly on top of each other, not a beat. You cannot accept the unconfirmed events that fill the ladder and reject the unconfirmed events that break it. One standard of proof, applied to all of them.

  Propagated through `excursions.html`, `settled.html`, `index.html`, `dismissals.html`, `objections.html`, `sitemap.html`, `sources.html`, `AGENTS.md` and corpus files 02, 03, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10. Also replaced the favicon, which had been a straight copy of Grain by Grain's sand-strata mark: now a gold sun inside a shed shell, cradled by two teal field arcs, so the two sites are distinguishable in a tab strip.

  **Lesson worth keeping:** on this corpus the first-pass verdicts were systematically harsher than the literature supports, in exactly the direction [[note-to-the-next]] warns about. Search-result summaries flatten "proposed but unconfirmed" into "unsupported". Those are different words and the difference is the whole argument.

- **2026-08-01 (the reframe):** Two corrections from Luke, both structural, both mine to have caught.

  **First:** the site was answering "is the micronova true?" when the question is "what does the record say about how often the quiet ends?" Built `calm.html` as the new second page and the thesis of the whole thing: the Holocene as the anomaly rather than the baseline. Greenland ice shows temperature lurches of 5 to 16 degrees inside decades, roughly every 1,500 years, synchronous across the North Atlantic and east Asia within 5 to 10 years. None in the Holocene. Richerson, Boyd and Bettinger (2001, *American Antiquity*) is the load-bearing citation: agriculture was impossible in the Pleistocene because of the variability and close to mandatory once the Holocene settled. Everything we call civilisation sits inside the one calm window, and the mainstream explanation for civilisation existing at all is that calm. Added a return-period table across seven hazard classes, all mainstream, all with published intervals. The "overdue" framing is explicitly corrected as a gambler's fallacy, which strengthens rather than weakens the case: random arrival at those intervals still climbs towards certainty over the span anyone builds for.

  **Second, and the more important one:** the build had the micronova sitting on top of the cadence, so it inherited the cadence's weakness. That is backwards. Restructured the layers everywhere so the clock is last and weakest and the mechanism does not depend on it:
  - L1 excursions happen: **known**
  - L2 the Sun does things far past our records: **known**
  - L3 the Sun's surroundings change enough to matter: **known**, and this is new
  - L4 that makes a star like ours shed a shell: **speculative**, the only genuinely open step
  - L5 on a clean 6,000 or 12,000-year clock: **disputed**, weakest, and least needed

  **The L3 find matters and I had missed it.** Opher et al., *Nature Astronomy*, 10 June 2024: about 2 Ma the Solar System crossed a cold dense interstellar cloud dense enough to compress the heliosphere to ~0.22 AU, inside Earth's orbit, leaving the planet in raw interstellar medium. A second likely episode ~7 Ma at the Local Bubble edge, and work under way to find the fingerprint in lunar soil. Plus the Radcliffe Wave (Alves et al., *Nature*, Jan 2020), a rippling gas ribbon ~3 kpc long through the Sun's neighbourhood. Mainstream astronomy now says the Sun's environment changes drastically. That is not the frontier's trigger, and it is a much stronger setting than the first build gave it. Split `mechanism.html` link 2 accordingly: a compressed bubble is not an accumulated shell, and both halves now carry their own label.

  Nav restructured (`The calm` added, `Numbers` moved out of the top bar and left to the rail, inline links and the map). SEQUENCE updated. 15 pages now. Verified: zero em dashes, all links resolve, all 200, no overflow.

  **Lesson worth keeping:** the first build's failure was not a wrong fact, it was a wrong dependency graph. Bundling a strong claim with a weak one and labelling the bundle by its weakest member is the same flattening error as reading "proposed but unconfirmed" as "unsupported". Check what actually depends on what before assigning a chip.

- **2026-08-01 (the static Solar System assumption):** Luke, on the L3 framing: "you think the planets stayed where they are when the medium changes. how cute." He was right and it was a real hole, not a nitpick. I had written the environment as changing around a Solar System held fixed, and never examined the second half.

  What the literature actually says:
  - **The orbits are not fixed and never were.** Milankovitch: eccentricity near 100 and 405 kyr, obliquity 22.1 to 24.5 degrees on 41 kyr, precession near 20 kyr. Those switch the ice ages on and off, which means the glacial rhythm making the Holocene look unusual *is itself an orbital rhythm*. That should have been on the page from the start, since the whole calm-as-anomaly argument rests on it.
  - **The configuration is chaotic.** Laskar: divergence by a factor of ten every 10 Myr, hard limit near 50 to 60 Myr on any unique astronomical solution. Beyond that, geology constrains the astronomy rather than the reverse.
  - **And the isolated-system assumption is now retired, in Kaib and Raymond's own words:** "most prior works approximate the solar system as an isolated system and neglect our surrounding Galaxy" (*ApJL*, 2024, arXiv:2402.08734). Passing field stars perturb the giant planets, shorten the window on Earth's orbital history by a further ~10%, and open orbital paths before ~50 Ma that no earlier model produced. HD 7977 passed exceptionally close 2.8 Ma. The 2025 follow-up (arXiv:2505.04737) puts the system ~50% less stable with flybys included, Pluto at ~5% destabilisation over 5 Gyr against a prior assumption of complete stability.
  - **And a visitor is on the record within the human span:** Scholz's Star passed ~0.82 light years, five times nearer than Proxima is now, about 70,000 years ago, through the outer Oort cloud. Identified only in 2015.

  Added as section three of `calm.html`, with the limit stated plainly in the same block: every one of those effects is gravitational and runs over millions of years, not centuries, so the stronger claim that a charge-environment change rearranges things on a human timescale goes past these papers and is marked as going past them.

  **Lesson worth keeping, and it is the same one twice now.** Both of Luke's catches this session were the same species of error: an unexamined assumption inherited from the consensus framing, not a wrong fact. First the micronova stacked on the cadence, then the medium changing around a static Solar System. In both cases the consensus itself had already moved and I was carrying the older, tidier picture. Check what the framing assumes before checking what the claims assert.

- **2026-08-01 (the galaxy page):** Luke asked me to look into whether novae and supernovae are now thought to be required for the galaxy's stability. They are, and it is the strongest thing found all session. New page `galaxy.html`.
  - **Overcooling.** Gravity and cooling gas alone overproduce stars badly. Stellar feedback is what makes simulated galaxies match observed ones. Star formation is self-regulating and the regulator is stars exploding.
  - **The galactic fountain and baryon cycle.** Supernova-driven outflows lift metal-rich gas, which cools and falls back to fuel the next round. Explosions are the pump.
  - **The gem, and it is a real one.** The leading account of how galaxies keep their magnetic fields is the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo: cosmic rays from supernova remnants are buoyant, they lift loops of field, and that lifting is **the Parker instability**. Parker proposed it in 1992; Hanasz et al. built the first numerical model, driven by cosmic rays injected in supernova remnants, amplifying on a timescale near 250 Myr. **The frontier invokes the Parker instability for the galactic current sheet and the textbook invokes it for the galactic dynamo. Same physics, and only one of them gets accused of inventing it.**
  - **Novae do the chemistry.** Beryllium in Nova Delphini 2013 and lithium in Nova Centauri 2013, both 2015, confirmed in many novae since. Running conclusion: novae are the main source of the Milky Way's lithium, at a few billionths of a solar mass per event. Amounts still argued, and the measurements came in above the models.
  - **Where it stops, stated on the page:** micronovae have no proposed galactic role by anyone, and burn about a millionth of a classical nova's material. Every rung with an established galactic role is a star destroying itself or burning stolen fuel on a dead surface. Ours does neither.

  The honest conclusion is the useful one: the category is respectable, and the specific case still has to be made on its own. This is the clearest [[surface-the-gem]] result of the build. The frontier's framing line, that outbursts may be how a galaxy moves energy outward at all, reads as overreach and is close to the standard account.

- **2026-08-01 (the Earth turning over):** Luke: "havent even looked at the earth turning over yet... why are there glaciers in the equatorial zones? why are there magnetic anomolies in the bermuda triangle and the atipole in asia?" Three questions, three completely different strengths. New page `turning.html`.
  - **It has a mainstream name and it is not crustal displacement.** **True polar wander**: the whole solid Earth, mantle and crust together, rotating relative to the spin axis because mass redistribution changes the inertia tensor. Accepted, actively published (Vaes et al., *AGU Advances*, 2025, doi:10.1029/2024AV001515). Distinct from Hapgood/Thomas crustal displacement, where the crust alone slips over the mantle, which is not accepted. Both give the same observable. Only one has to be defended.
  - **Ninety degrees was published in *Science*.** Kirschvink, Ripperdan and Evans, 1997: inertial interchange TPW, the entire mantle and crust rotating ~90 degrees in ~15 Myr, ~30 cm/yr, ten times normal continental drift, proposed as connected to the Cambrian explosion. **Contested and currently not supported**: the pole selection has been argued over hard, and re-analysis plus new Laurentia and Baltica data plus a revised timescale point the other way. The better-supported cases are smaller, including ~84 Ma.
  - **Antarctica warm is settled and the provenance is extraordinary.** Scott's party collected 16 kg of rock below Mount Buckley in January 1912 on the way back from the Pole, still hauling it when they were found. *Glossopteris* leaves and coal, ~280 Myr, Permian. Scott's own journal describes coal with leaves traced through it in layers. Became early evidence for continental drift. Mechanism is Gondwana break-up over 100+ Myr, not a flip, but the observable is not in dispute at all.
  - **Glaciers at the equator is two questions.** Modern ones (Cayambe, the only snow where the equator actually crosses, plus Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya, Rwenzori, Puncak Jaya) are altitude and not mysterious; >99% of tropical ice is Andean. **The real one** is Cryogenian glacial deposits at near-equatorial palaeolatitude, a 60-year paradox with two serious answers: Snowball Earth, and **Williams' high obliquity hypothesis** (*Nature* 1998 on obliquity-oblateness feedback, formalised as HOLIST in *Earth-Science Reviews* 2008), where a tilt above 54 degrees makes the equator colder than the poles. A mainstream geologist arguing the planet's orientation was radically different, in real journals, precisely to explain this evidence. Known hole: the Moon stabilises obliquity and the proposed route back down has been invalidated.
  - **Bermuda is the one to drop, and the antipode claim is geometrically false.** NOAA finds no elevated disappearance rate. The agonic line is a line of zero declination, which is the absence of a correction rather than the presence of a disturbance, and it drifts. No evidence of an unusual anomaly. And **Bermuda's antipode is in the Indian Ocean off Western Australia near Perth, not Japan**, which anyone can check in seconds. The genuine largest crustal anomalies are Kursk (~10,000 nT, banded iron) and Bangui (~700 x 1,000 km), both understood geology.
  - **Where the proposed mechanism runs out, stated on the page:** reorientation is a mass argument from beginning to end, and electric charge does not redistribute a planet's interior mass. No worked mechanism connects a charged upper atmosphere to the inertia tensor, including from the people making the claim.

  Not added to the top nav, which is at its limit of eight at the 940px breakpoint. Reached from the reading rail after `mechanism.html`, from the crust-unlocking link on that page, from `calm.html`, and from the map.

  **The pricing lesson, and it is the sharpest instance yet of the repo's own rule:** an argument is priced by its weakest quoted claim. The antipode line is wrong in ten seconds, and bringing it into a conversation gets the fossil forests and the *Science* ninety-degree paper discarded along with it. Dropping it costs nothing because it was never carrying anything.

- **2026-08-01 (the Moon, and the antipode idea):** Luke: "you assume that the moon was always there with your use of it to stabilise earth." Sixth catch, same species as the other five: an assumption inherited from the tidy picture and never examined. New page `moon.html`, and the objection corrected on `turning.html`.
  - **The stabilisation is a phase, not a property.** Laskar, Joutel and Robutel (*Nature*, 1993): without the Moon the obliquity roams ~0 to 85 degrees. But it works through the **precession rate**, which is a function of lunar distance and Earth's spin rate, both of which have changed enormously. Tidal recession is expected to push Earth's rotation into the chaotic zone within 1.5 to 4.5 Gyr, with excursions above 80 degrees after that. Same planet, same Moon, no longer stabilised. Using it as a timeless objection was wrong and is now retired site-wide.
  - **And the bigger one: a leading lunar-origin model has the Earth on its side.** &Cacute;uk, Hamilton, Lock and Stewart (2016): a giant impact leaving Earth spinning under a 2.5-hour day and tipped ~70 degrees (θ > 61°), with the Moon accreting in the equatorial plane of a highly oblique Earth, and the Laplace plane transition later shedding the excess angular momentum and generating the lunar inclination. Proposed because it solves the Earth-Moon isotopic similarity, which is the standing flaw in the classic model. **So "the Earth was radically differently oriented" is not an unthinkable proposition in the field.** Held honestly on the page: this is the first few tens of Myr and does not license a high tilt in the recent past. What it retires is the reflex that the idea is silly.
  - **The ringing is real.** Apollo 12, 20 Nov 1969, ascent stage dropped ~72.5 km from a seismometer deployed three days earlier, vibration for over 55 minutes, and it genuinely surprised the people watching. Explained by the **megaregolith**: kilometres of impact-fractured, extremely dry rock that scatters seismic energy instead of damping it. Hollow is excluded by mean density. The real explanation is more interesting than the myth and the page says so.
  - **The speculative wrappers are labelled as Luke labelled them** ("speculative fun, but anomalous none the less"), in a table separating the genuinely odd (ringing, isotopic similarity, size relative to the planet, the eclipse coincidence of this era, low density) from the invented (hollow, placed on purpose). Per [[reality-fiction-seeding]]: surface the gem, do not frame the fiction as an error.
  - **His antipode idea holds up and is now an open test.** The proposal: one hit gives one strong signature and whatever appears on the far side is a consequence, so it leaves a different mark and a search for a matching pair keeps failing. **Antipodal focusing is established.** Schultz and Gault (1975); Mercury's "weird terrain" sits directly opposite Caloris with modelled vertical ground movement near 1 km; the Moon has the same opposite Imbrium. Later work finds focused **guided** waves matter more than direct body waves, including mantle waves trapped between core and surface. The far side gets broken, jumbled, dropped ground rather than a crater, which is exactly the asymmetry he described. Added to `test.html` as a real open test with three checkable questions: whether the focusing touches magnetism as well as surface, whether Earth's lopsided field has antipodal structure, and whether repeated events stack a distinguishable far-side record. No new instruments needed.

  **Six catches, one pattern, and it is worth stating flatly for whoever reads this next.** Not one of them was a wrong fact. Every one was an unexamined framing assumption carried over from the consensus picture: the ladder summaries, the point of the site, the micronova stacked on the cadence, the static Solar System, the galaxy as backdrop, and now the Moon as a permanent fixture. The consensus had already moved on several of them. **Check what the framing assumes before checking what the claims assert.**

- **2026-08-02 (the ice cores):** Luke: "and try and find the toba erruption in ice cores. antarctica wasn't the southe pole then." Two claims in one line, and they come apart completely. Both now on `turning.html` as sections seven and eight.
  - **Toba is genuinely hard to pin down, and his instinct here is right.** One of the largest eruptions of the Quaternary, confidently identified on land and in marine cores as the Youngest Toba Tuff, and its **exact position in the ice record is ambiguous**. Four candidate sulphate peaks, T1 to T4, across NGRIP, GRIP, GISP2, EDC and EDML, all sitting inside the uncertainty on the 40Ar/39Ar date. Zielinski et al. (1996) put the sulphur loading at 230 to 1,140 Tg S over ~6 years, a range wide enough to drive a truck through. Live work continues: Crick et al., *Climate of the Past* 17, 2119 (2021) on sulfur isotopes; Svensson et al., *QSR* (2023) on bipolar constraints. Real caution about how confidently anything gets pinned in these archives, and it applies to the sceptic's side too.
  - **Antarctica was at the South Pole, and this is the hardest correction in the whole build.** The continent reached its present polar position around **83 Ma** and has been glaciated since about **34 Ma**. Continuous, layered ice: **at least 1.2 million years** from the 2025 Beyond EPICA core to bedrock, 800,000 years and eight full cycles from Dome C, 123,000 years undisturbed from NGRIP, and continuous through the Eemian to ~128 ka at NEEM. A continent that travelled to the tropics at 12 ka or 74 ka loses its ice and the record with it. **Both ice sheets sat still and stayed cold through every window in which a recent crustal shift is claimed.**
  - **Stated on the page with its limits, per the repo's own standard.** It does not touch geomagnetic excursions, which change the field and move no ground. It does not touch deep-time true polar wander, well before the ice. And the strongest available reply is given: a smaller shift leaving both sheets in the cold would not destroy the record. With its follow-up: ice chemistry tracks temperature, so even a modest latitude change leaves a signature, and the last million years read as ordinary glacial cycles.
  - **The framing that makes it useful rather than just a defeat:** the ice is simultaneously the strongest evidence *for* the recurrence thesis (it carries the Dansgaard-Oeschger lurches, the Miyake spikes, the volcanic record) and the strongest evidence *against* a recent turn. Same cores, both directions. That is the ledger working as designed.

  Also added to `numbers.html` as two priced rows and to `AGENTS.md` with an explicit instruction not to soften it. Seven catches now; this is the first where the answer ran against Luke, and it needed to be delivered without softening for the same reason all the others needed delivering without flattening.

- **2026-08-02 (the other planets, and a currency discipline):** Luke: "it's time to look at the other planets in the solar system for signs of climate change and increasing seismic activity... could be explained away or could be a pattern." Plus: "do your own searches for more up to date content as the books are out of date, and so is your training corpus." Both acted on. New page `planets.html`.
  - **Two hold and are genuinely unexplained.** **Venus**: cloud-top winds rose from ~300 to nearly 400 km/h between 2006 and 2013, tracked across 45,000 features by hand and 350,000 automatically from orbit. Khatuntsev's own words: never before observed on Venus, not yet understood. The frontier's "33% faster" figure is accurate. **Neptune**: stratosphere cooled at least 7 K to 2018, then the south pole warmed ~11 K in two years, reversing the trend. Never seen before on Neptune. Cause stated as unknown, and **the candidates listed in the paper include the 11-year solar cycle**, which is a mainstream paper floating solar activity as a driver of an outer-planet anomaly.
  - **Two are real with good local answers.** Uranus (84-year orbit, extreme tilt, no internal heat, equinox 2007) and Pluto (248-year orbit, thermal lag, nitrogen now refreezing as models predicted though larger than predicted).
  - **One to drop.** "Mars is warming faster than Earth" traces to Fenton et al., *Nature* 2007, on **regional** albedo change from dust redistribution, predicting **0.65 K in total across ~two decades, not per year**, and *Nature* published an erratum because the wording was read that way. Mars is not warming globally. It has been circulated as solar-system-wide-heating evidence for nearly twenty years.
  - **One to state properly.** Mars seismicity is real: 1,300+ marsquakes, S1222a at M4.7 on 4 May 2022 releasing as much moment as everything else catalogued combined, tectonic rather than impact. But that says Mars is more active *than we assumed*, not that it is *becoming* more active. No prior baseline exists. Those get run together and should not be.
  - **The two decisive objections, both on the page.** The changes do not share a direction: Uranus's upper atmosphere has been cooling for thirty years (JWST, published 2026), Neptune cooled then had a pole warm, Venus sped up, Pluto rose then fell. Several things happening, not one thing in several places. And there is no denominator: nobody says how many bodies showed nothing.
  - **The caution that cuts both ways**, and it mirrors the calm page's own argument: Uranus takes 84 years to orbit, Neptune 165, Pluto 248. We have watched most of them for a fraction of one of their years, so "seasonal" and "changing" are very hard to separate. That limits the sceptic as much as the frontier.

  **Currency sweep, per Luke's instruction, and three items run in favour of taking the Sun more seriously:**
  - **Solar Cycle 25 beat its forecast.** Official 2019 panel: weak, peak ~115 sunspot number, mid-2025. Revised upward 2023. Actual smoothed peak ~161 in **October 2024**, counts at a 23-year high, X9.0 flare on 3 October 2024. The consensus underestimated the Sun again, in public, within the last two years.
  - **May 2024 was the first G5 storm since October 2003.** Roughly half of ~10,000 low-orbit payloads manoeuvred, the largest coordinated satellite movement on record; record ionospheric depletion; one Starlink re-entry accelerated ~11 days; grid operators managing voltage all weekend. Nothing failed, and it was nowhere near the top of the scale.
  - **The South Atlantic Anomaly, 11 years of Swarm to 2025** (Finlay et al., *Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors*): expanded by an area near half of continental Europe since 2014, weakening faster since 2020 south-west of Africa, and structurally not a single block.

  Added to `settled.html`, `numbers.html`, `sources.html`, and `AGENTS.md` now carries a **standing currency instruction**: this field moves fast, the frontier texts stop in 2022, always search for developments rather than answering from training data. That instruction should be treated as permanent for this repo.

- **2026-08-02 (register correction, the lunar magnetotail hypothesis, and the auroral baseline):** Three things from Luke in one exchange.

  **1. He objected to "understood", and he was right about a specific instance.** His framing: "it's all conjecture and working hypotheses but academics love to exagerate." The repo said the Kursk and Bangui anomalies were "understood geology". Bangui's origin is genuinely contested: Girdler, Taylor and Frawley (1992) proposed a ~1 Ga meteorite impact; others argued major crustal fracturing or a large igneous body; recent gravity and magnetic imaging places banded iron and mafic granulites to ~38 km and argues against the impact. The balance now favours the geological source, which is not the same as understood. Corrected on `turning.html` and `sources.html`. **`AGENTS.md` now carries the general instruction**: do not launder a working hypothesis into a settled fact by calling it "understood"; the confident register of mainstream science is a stylistic habit, not an epistemic entitlement; reserve KNOWN for things measured directly rather than for the leading explanation of a measurement; the five labels are a scale of corroboration, not a boundary between fact and speculation. **This is a permanent rule and it should be applied on every future pass.**

  **2. His second original hypothesis, and it has a cleaner test than the antipode one.** "The moon travelling through the magnetosphere is part of the tidal and earthquake mechanics." Checked, and the components are all established:
  - The Moon **enters Earth's magnetotail about three days before full and takes ~6 days to cross**, meeting the plasma sheet; nightside surface charging reaches hundreds to thousands of volts.
  - **Bell, *JGR* 1964 and 1966**: geomagnetic activity runs ~4% **below** average for the seven days before full moon and ~4% **above** for the seven days after, with a further dependence on the Moon's distance from the ecliptic. Measured, sixty years old, sitting there.
  - **Tidal triggering of earthquakes is published**: Ide, Yabe and Tanaka, *Nature Geoscience* 9, 834-837 (2016), probability of a large earthquake greater at maximum tidal stress; deep tremor in subduction zones tracks tidal stress closely. Contested at M8+ (Hough found nothing across four centuries).
  - **The two literatures appear never to have been joined**, which is the hypothesis.
  - **And the test is decisive because the two effects disagree about the month.** Gravitational tide peaks at *both* new and full moon, so a purely gravitational effect must be symmetric. Magnetotail passage happens *only* at full, and its geomagnetic signature is itself asymmetric about full. Subtract the tidal-stress prediction from a public earthquake catalogue, examine the residual by lunar phase. Flat kills it; a lean toward the days after full moon is not something gravity can produce. Public data only, no new instruments. Sections six and seven of `moon.html`, plus `test.html`.

  **3. The auroral baseline, and it is the strongest single item found in the whole build.** Luke: "how many solar storms created low latitude auroras. lol... and the strength of those storms." Low-latitude aurora sightings in chronicles, logs and newspapers let extreme storms be reconstructed *and quantified* centuries before instruments:
  - **September 1770**: 111 East Asian documents, displays below 30 degrees magnetic latitude on nine consecutive nights.
  - **September 1859 Carrington**: roughly -950 nT, but estimates span about -685 to -2000 depending on method, and there is a 2024 paper titled for that uncertainty. **Quote it as a range, never a number.**
  - **February 1872 Chapman-Silverman**: 700+ auroral records worldwide, aurora to about 20 degrees latitude in *both* hemispheres, minimum conservatively <= -834 nT, and the auroral boundary suggests it **may have exceeded 1859 and 1921**.
  - **May 1921**: about -907 nT.
  - **990s**: auroral evidence for great magnetic storms, and 993 CE is a confirmed Miyake event. Written and physical archives agreeing independently.
  - **The comparison that does the work: May 2024 measured -412 nT**, was the sixth largest since the index began in 1957, and produced the largest satellite manoeuvre in history. **Three historical storms are roughly two to four times its size and all of them happened after 1770.** So the event that stressed the modern world was a moderate one arriving in a world with far more plugged in, and "Carrington was a once-in-centuries one-off" is not supported.

  Added as a new section on `settled.html`, two rows on `numbers.html`, a corrected return-period row on `calm.html`, sources, and `AGENTS.md`.

- **2026-08-02 (the catastrophe stories, and a currency miss of my own):** Luke asked for pages on catastrophe mythology, with the framing "they ain't myths" and the question: "why would the only surviving storys from a species lineage of millions of years be catastrohpe stories?" Two new pages, `stories.html` and `ages.html`.
  - **The strongest evidence in the world for his framing is Australian, and it is peer-reviewed.** Nunn and Reid, *Australian Geographer* 47(1), 2016: **21 Aboriginal accounts from 21 locations around the entire coast**, describing the sea taking land. 19 recovered from written collections made over the last two centuries, 2 from interviews. Sea level around Australia settled at its present position roughly 7,000 years ago, so the accounts must predate that. The authors' own word is **corroboration**: empirical corroboration of postglacial sea-level rise, across roughly **300 generations**. And the mechanism is documented: kin-based responsibility for who holds which knowledge, plus cross-generational cross-checking by elders. A maintained technology for keeping a record true. The orthodox expectation is that oral accounts rarely hold shape past a millennium; these are the counterexample.
  - **Two more matched cases.** Klamath accounts of the Mount Mazama collapse ~7,700 years ago (red-hot rocks the size of hills, fire over the forests, the mountain falling, the hollow filling with rain) with **human sandals recovered beneath the Mazama ash**. And the 1700 Cascadia rupture, where **three independent archives agree**: Japanese written records of an orphan tsunami on the night of 26 January 1700, Pacific Northwest oral traditions placing a Thunderbird-and-Whale event on a winter night, and ghost forests plus tsunami sand. M8.7 to 9.2.
  - **The ages page carries the Five Suns properly** (jaguars, wind, rain of fire, flood, and the current Four Movement ending in earthquakes) and **handles the Hopi material with the provenance flagged**: most popular retellings derive from a contested 1963 book compiled by an outsider, which Hopi people have publicly objected to. Reported as a book about the tradition rather than the tradition. That is the same provenance discipline as the Bermuda antipode, applied to somebody's living religion, where it matters more.
  - **The answer to his question, and it supplies a mechanism.** Oral tradition is expensive to maintain, so what survives is what is worth the cost, and that is survival information. A catastrophe-dominated record is exactly what oral tradition should look like if it functions as survival technology. The bias is the mechanism, not a flaw in it. **And the same selection explains universality without any single global event**, so it cannot be used to argue for one. Both halves are on the page.
  - **The sharpest point, and it improves his case rather than weakening it:** specific beats universal. Twenty-one accounts each matching *their own* coastline is far stronger evidence than a thousand cultures having a flood story, because the universal version is compatible with almost anything and the specific version is a dated, located, checkable claim that came out right.

  **And a currency miss that was mine.** Luke: "I just read your aurora data and it's not up to date. there's been at least 3 more." Correct, and it was the instruction I had written into `AGENTS.md` one exchange earlier and then failed to apply to my own table. Since May 2024 there have been at least five further storms putting the aurora well outside its usual range: **severe events in October 2024, November 2025, 19 January 2026 and late July 2026, plus a strong one in early July 2026** reaching New Mexico with magenta light over northern California. None close to the historical entries in size. Added to `settled.html`, `planets.html`, `numbers.html` and `sources.html`, each with an explicit note that the list goes stale within months. **The lesson: writing a currency rule into the brief is not the same as running it. Sweep forward on every dated table, every pass.**
